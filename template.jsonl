While this enhances functionality, it also introduces a risk of stack overflow if the recursion depth is too great, especially when comparing deeply nested objects. This could lead to application crashes or denial of service.\nImpact:\nIf left unresolved, this issue could result in stack overflow vulnerabilities, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. In severe cases, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing deeply nested objects, leading to denial of service.\nAdvice:\nTo address this issue, consider implementing an iterative approach instead of recursion for comparing nested objects. Alternatively, limit the recursion depth to a safe threshold to prevent stack overflow. If recursion is necessary, ensure proper tail call optimization is applied or use a trampoline pattern to manage the call stack. Additionally, validate input objects to reject excessively nested structures."}

If unaligned pointers are passed, it could result in a fatal exception (9), causing the application to crash.\nImpact:\nIf this issue is left unresolved, passing unaligned pointers to `transferBytes_` could lead to a fatal exception, crashing the application. This could result in data corruption, system instability, or unexpected behavior, especially in production environments where debugging is not enabled.\nAdvice:\nTo resolve this issue, add an `ASSERT()` statement at the beginning of the `transferBytes_` function to validate the alignment of the `in` and `out` pointers. This will help catch alignment issues during development and debugging. For example: `ASSERT((uintptr_t)out % 4 == 0 && (uintptr_t)in % 4 == 0);`. Additionally, consider adding a runtime check with a meaningful error message for production builds to gracefully handle alignment issues without crashing the application."}
